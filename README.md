A bunch of scripts to develop, benchmark, debug or help in using VROOM.

- **overpass_to_json** generates a problem from all OSM nodes with a
  specific `amenity` tag value in a chosen bounding box or city.
- **random_problem** generates a ready-to-solve random problem based
  on a bounding box.
- **global_indicators** collects indicators on all solutions contained
  in a folder.
- **json_to_csv** dumps all locations coordinates from a json input
  instance to a csv file.
